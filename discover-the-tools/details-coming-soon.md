# Partial Tool Listing

This section of the documentation will have a detailed, categorized listing of the tools available as part of REMnux, but the listing isn't ready yet.

In the meantime, you can see a [partial listing in a Google Docs sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6JKUqOoYH-d6Q2BBMZSLQyC5i8N9vmPu0Vn3x0bhVc/edit?usp=sharing), which is still a work in progress. The listing includes the name, author, license, and other details for each tool.
