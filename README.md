# REMnux: A Linux Toolkit for Malware Analysts

![](.gitbook/assets/remnux-logo.png)

This site provides official documentation for [REMnux](https://REMnux.org/)Â®, a Linux toolkit for reverse-engineering or otherwise examining malicious software. REMnux provides a curated collection of free tools created by the community. Malware analysts can start investigating malware without having to find, install, and configure the tools.

## Install the REMnux Distro

The heart of the toolkit is the REMnux Linux distribution based on Ubuntu 18.04. It incorporates many tools for analyzing malicious:

* Executables and binaries
* Scripts, including JavaScript
* Documents, including Microsoft Office and PDF files
* Network interactions, such as C2 communications

The [Discover the Tools](https://docs.remnux.org/discover-the-tools) section of this site shows which tools comprise the REMnux distro. To start using these tools, you can:

* [Download the REMnux distro as a pre-built virtual appliance.](install-distro/get-virtual-appliance.md)
* [Install the REMnux distro from scratch on a dedicated system.](install-distro/install-from-scratch.md)
* [Add the REMnux distro to an existing machine.](install-distro/add-to-existing-system.md)

## Keep REMnux Up to Date

Keep your REMnux system up to date by running the following command once in a while, so you benefit from the latest enhancements, after connecting the system to the internet:

```text
remnux upgrade
```

Even if if the `upgrade` command tells you, "No upgrades available," you can still refresh your current tools. The following operation will make sure that you're running the latest versions of the installed [Debian packages](behind-the-scenes/technologies/debian-packages.md) and Python modules, without adding adding any new tools to your system:

```text
remnux update
```

To sum up, the `upgrade` option updates all the tools and adds new ones that might have been incorporated into the REMnux distro. The `update` command is a subset, and updates your existing Debian packages and Python modules.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you're running the REMnux distro in a virtual machine, consider taking a snapshot before upgrading or updating your VM, so you can revert to a good state in case something goes wrong.
{% endhint %}

## Run Tools in Containers <a id="run-in-containers"></a>

The REMnux toolkit also offers [Docker images of popular malware analysis tools](run-tools-in-containers/remnux-containers.md), making it possible to run the applications as containers without having to install them directly on the system.

## Get Involved with the Project

You can participate in the REMnux project by:

* [Asking and answering questions](get-involved/ask-and-answer-questions.md) related to the distro and its tools.
* [Adding or updating tools](get-involved/add-or-update-tools/) that comprise the distribution.
* [Creating articles, blog posts, and videos](get-involved/write-about-the-tools.md) about the tools on REMnux.

## Learn More About REMnux

You can learn about the [people](behind-the-scenes/people.md) and [technologies](behind-the-scenes/technologies/) that make REMnux possible.
