# Technologies

The major technologies that work together to make REMnux possible are:

* [SaltStack Files](saltstack-management.md): Manage the installation and configuration of the building blocks of the distro.
* [Debian Packages](debian-packages.md): Bundle software components for a reliable installation and updates.
* [REMnux Installer](remnux-installer.md): Start the installation and upgrade of the distro.
* [Docker Containers](): Package applications so they can run without a direct installation.

You can read about how REMnux uses these technologies to learn from the approach and, if you wish, to [contribute new tools](../../get-involved/add-or-update-tools/) to the project.
